Dart Filename Commentor is a Visual Studio Code extension that automatically inserts a commented-out version of the file name at the top of Dart files when they are saved. This extension is particularly useful for Flutter projects where maintaining references to file names can aid in development.

## Features

- Automatically inserts a commented-out file name at the top of Dart files on save.
- Supports Flutter projects by providing relative paths from the 'lib' directory.
- Avoids overwriting existing comments or manually added file name references.
- Compatible with Visual Studio Code's built-in save functionality.
- Inspired by the need to easily copy and paste file names into chat platforms like ChatGPT or Gemini.

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar.
3. Search for "Dart Filename Commentor" and click on Install.

## Usage

- Simply save a Dart file, and the extension will insert a commented-out file name at the top of the document if it doesn't already exist.

## Configuration

- There are currently no configuration options for this extension.
